# 1a - What is SunVox?

SunVox is a modular sound design environment with a tracker based sequencer. The sound design environment is modular much in the same way as a modular synthesizer, but its capabilities extend far beyond what you might expect from a modular synth. The tracker based sequencer is derived from the original tracker based sequencers (Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64) which predated modern day DAWs (Ableton, Logic, etc.) As it turns out, however, progress is not always in a straight line, and a tracker based approach still holds many advantages over the more "modern" graphical approaches. If you dislike all the mousing around that comes with working in a DAW, you will appreciate a tracker based workflow. In some ways you could compare working in a DAW with your computer's GUI (ie. the finder on a MAC) and working in SunVox with working on the command line (ie. Terminal).

SunVox is unconventional, spartan, fast, efficient, and very powerful. It is not easy, but it is simple, which is far more useful as well as more difficult to achieve. The user needs to surrender to and accept it to to become productive with it, but once there, you can do things that are just not possible in other music making environments.

SunVox is also hands down the most powerful fully portable music making application there is, period. You can work on a SunVox project on your top of the line laptop, then open and work on that same session on your phone. SunVox will [adjust its engine](http://www.warmplace.ru/wiki/doku.php?id=sunvox:manual_en#comparison_of_different_versions) for CPU efficiency based on the host technology, and given it is already ultra efficient anyway, its pretty incredible how much SunVox lets you get done on portable/touch screen formats.

Anyone can learn SunVox, right now I am teaching my 7 year old son and he loves it. But I think certain people will be able to adjust their mindset to the SunVox way of doing things better than others. Below is my totally biased opinion of who should and shouldn't learn SunVox:

### Who should learn SunVox
* People who have never made electronic music before
* People who have been making electronic music for a long time
* People who own no plugins
* People who have been producing music long enough to where they only use about half the plugins they own cause they lost their authorizations for the others
* People who have used most or all of the major DAWs over the years and reckon that, despite their differences, they're all about the same
* People who appreciate the place where limits and freedom overlap
* People who appreciate subversive underground under-the-radar but in many ways superior technology
* People who appreciate the advantages of a self-contained music making environment
* People who like the idea of thinking of automation information in discreet values vs. clicking and dragging approximate shapes with lines
* People who have used the mouse enough to get sick of it or tendonitis and appreciate a more mouseless workflow
* People who appreciate software with a focused vision and approach, vs. a please everyone by committee approach
* People who appreciate the portability factor
* People who appreciate software by a developer who charges about ten times too little money, is responsive on the forum and groups, has been issuing consistent amazing updates over 10 years, and seems to be driven by artistry more than industry
* People with software development backgrounds who can appreciate the elegance of componentization via MetaModules
* People who despise the Musical Industrial Complex
* People who would rather go to the dentist than NAMM

### People who should not learn SunVox (yet)
* People who get really frustrated when some music software doesn't do exactly what they want in the way that they want it and spend a lot of time complaining about this on forums
* People who want to master a certain current genre in a way that quickly gives them a shot at becoming popular (there's nothing at all wrong with wanting this, and if so, the best approach will be to study the many tutorials out there for more conventional DAWs in the genre you are looking to target. Just beware that this is the path thousands of others are taking too. See the difference between the Blue Ocean and the Red Ocean.)
* People who don't want to deal with numbers and discreet values
* People who look forward to NAMM and find it really exciting and enjoyable
