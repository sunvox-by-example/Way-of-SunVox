_The Way of the warrior does not include other Ways, such as Confucianism,
Buddhism, certain traditions, artistic accomplishments and dancing. But even though
these are not part of the Way, if you know the Way broadly you will see it in everything.
Men must polish their particular Way. - Miyamoto Musashi_

# Installing SunVox

![](1b.jpg)

SunVox runs on a lot of different devices. Probably more than any other music app. No one knows how Alex, the sole developer, achieves this and stays sane, but somehow he does. My guess is Russian energy drinks. For installation the best resource is the official [wiki](http://www.warmplace.ru/wiki/doku.php?id=sunvox:manual_en#installing).
