  - __Move between modules by ID__
    ```
    Assignable Shortcuts:
    NEXT MODULE (Default: Shift + >)
    PREVIOUS MODULE (Default: Shift + >)
    ```
    "Next" and "Previous" here refers to the ID of the module, which is a hexadecimal number, and appears above the module. "Next" moves the focus to the next higher number, "Previous" moves the focus to the next lower number.

  - __Move between modules horizontally__
    ```
    Assignable Shortcuts:
    NEXT MODULE HORIZONTALLY (Default: CTRL + Right)
    PREVIOUS MODULE HORIZONTALLY (Default: CTRL + Left)
    ```
    Horizontally here is measured by the module with the nearest location on the x-axis to the currently selected module. This can be counterintuitive at first because you naturally expect it to be the next or previous adjoining module horizontally, but horizontal here is very literal. One option to create this behavior is to arrange your modules in a grid.
