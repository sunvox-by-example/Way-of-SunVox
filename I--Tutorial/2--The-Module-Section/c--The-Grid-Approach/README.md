_There is no way to describe what a warrior should do other than he should adhere to
the Way of the warrior (Bushido)._

_I find that all men are negligent of this._

_There are few men who can quickly reply to the question "What is the Way of the Warrior?" This is because they do not know in their hearts. From this we can say they do not follow the Way of the warrior._

_By the Way of the warrior is meant death._
_The Way of the warrior is death. This means choosing death whenever there is a choice between life and death._

_It means nothing more than this._

_If you keep your spirit correct from morning to night, accustomed to the idea of death and resolved on death, and consider yourself as a dead body, thus becoming one with the Way of the warrior, you can pass through life with no possibility of failure_

_- Miyamoto Musashi_

# The Grid Approach

The focus is on building using the grid approach, where the main session includes a grid of MetaModules that contain "patches" comprising different instruments/voices used in the session. The goal is to introduce uniformity between session, avoiding rats nest patching, increasing organization, and making it easy to navigate across modules using shortcuts.
