1. Make sure the center left section is visible as in the gif above. If it is not, the center pane has been moved all the way to the left, click and drag right on the separator to expand the section. There are three separators in the app, one horizontal and two vertical, and all each can be dragged to resize and hide the four major sections of the UI.

2. This section is a series of sliders that correspond to the parameters of the module, ie. what you can change to alter the sound of the module. In SunVox these parameters are called controllers, and this window is the controller section.

3. As in the gif above, experiment with changing the paramters and then playing the module with keyboard to hear how changes alter the sound.
