This is a series that walks the user through how to make a track in Sunvox, with each tutorial addressing a specific part of the process. Example sessions and screengrabs are included in each tutorial. The focus is on building using the grid approach, where the main session includes a grid of MetaModules that contain "patches" comprising different instruments/voices used in the session. The goal is to introduce uniformity between session, avoiding rats nest patching, increasing organization, and making it easy to navigate across modules using shortcuts.
