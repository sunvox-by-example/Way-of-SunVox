things. When you attain the Way of strategy there will not be one thing you cannot see.
You must study hard. - Miyamoto Musashi_

# Way of SunVox

## About

This is a resource for the music creation application [SunVox](http://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/).

It is divided into 3 main sections - a tutorial, a reference, and a library of modules.

I. The [tutorial](I--Tutorial) guides the user through the music creation process in SunVox, working from the basics up through more advanced techniques. Animated gifs with text descriptions as well as example SunVox projects are provided for reference. When a technique or documentation is drawn from a forum post or another creator, that creator is credited. To begin the tutorial, start here: [What is SunVox](I--Tutorial/1--Introduction/a--What-is-SunVox).

II. The [reference](II--Reference) includes descriptions, documentation, and examples of each type of native module, each type of pattern effect, and a collection of techniques, approaches, and strategies with documentation and example `sunvox` projects.

III. The [library](III--Library) of modules is a collection of instruments, effects, presets, etc. in the `sunsynth` file format.

The name "Way of SunVox" is a reference to the "Way of Strategy" as written by Miyamoto Musashi, the greatest Samurai who ever lived, in his [Book of Five Rings](https://archive.org/stream/MiyamotoMusashi-BookOfFiveRingsgoRinNoSho/Book_of_Five_Rings_djvu.txt). This final work was dictated by Musashi to his understudy by his deathbed in a cave in 1645, recorded on one complete scroll. Musashi was undefeated in over 30 duels to the death, eventually fighting with wooden kendo swords instead of steel. Upon retiring from dueling, he turned his back on any potential to start a school or enjoy royal patronage in order to live the life of a creative aesthetic. Musashi went on to become one of the greatest artists, poets, philosophers, and musicians in Japan's history. His entire life was dedicated to the way of strategy, forged in battle and then applied to all creative expression.

## Workflow

This resource lives in a Github "Repo". Generallly Github is used to host code, but it works well for textual resources too. You can navigate through the repo in two ways:

1. Via links (see the Sitemap below on this page) that are embedded in the text associated with each section (the _README.md_ file)
2. Deeper/forwards into the site via the file structure box provided by Github (above), and outward/backwards via the breadcrumb/path (above the file structure box.)

Additionally, if you want to work locally from your computer while not being connected to the internet, you can do so by downloading this entire repo and opening the files locally (click the green `Clone or Download` button above) However note that the animated gifs will not be embedded in the .md docs, the links in the .md docs will not be active, and you will be reading raw markdown.

The optimal workflow is to download the repo so you have all the sunvox sessions, but read through the content here in Github.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repo are welcome, and Github  allows for easy contributions if you are familiar with the interface. If you'd like to contribute but don't want to take the time to learn github, just email me your contributions to mreveley (at) gmail.com.
