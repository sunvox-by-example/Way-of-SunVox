# Way of the SunVox
_There is no way to describe what a warrior should do other than he should adhere to
the Way of the warrior (Bushido)._

_I find that all men are negligent of this._

_There are few men who can quickly reply to the question "What is the Way of the Warrior?" This is because they do not know in their hearts. From this we can say they do not follow the Way of the warrior._

_By the Way of the warrior is meant death._
_The Way of the warrior is death. This means choosing death whenever there is a choice between life and death._

_It means nothing more than this._

_If you keep your spirit correct from morning to night, accustomed to the idea of death and resolved on death, and consider yourself as a dead body, thus becoming one with the Way of the warrior, you can pass through life with no possibility of failure_

_- Miyamoto Musashi_

## About

This is a resource for the music creation application SunVox.

It is divided into 3 main sections - a [tutorial](I--Tutorial), a [reference](II--Reference), and a [library](III--Library) of sunsyths.

I. The [tutorial](Tutorial) guides the user through the music creation process in SunVox, working from the basics up through more advanced techniques. Animated gifs with text descriptions as well as example SunVox projects are provided for reference. When a technique or documentation is drawn from a forum post or another creator, that creator is credited.

II. The [reference](II--Reference) includes descriptions, documentation, and examples of each type of native module, each type of pattern effect, and a collection of techniques, approaches, and strategies with documentation and example _sunvox_ projects.

III. The [library](Library) of sunsynths is a collection of modules (ie. instruments, effects, presets, etc - see the related tutorial [Understanding File Formats](Tutorial/1--Introduction/c--Understanding-File-Formats) for more information on the _sunsynth_ file format).

Some content is reprinted from the official [manual](http://www.warmplace.ru/wiki/doku.php?id=sunvox:manual_en#effects) - when this is the case the text will appear in `code blocks`.

The name "Way of the SunVox" is a combination of internet-speak and a reference to the "Way of the Sword" or the "Way of the Warrior", coined by Miyamoto Musashi, the greatest Samurai who ever lived, in his [Book of Five Rings](https://archive.org/stream/MiyamotoMusashi-BookOfFiveRingsgoRinNoSho/Book_of_Five_Rings_djvu.txt), dictated to his understudy on his deathbed in 1645. He was undefeated in over 30 duels to the death, eventually even fighting with wooden kendo swords instead of steel. Upon retiring from duelling, he turned his back on the potential for a school or royal patronage in order to live the life of a creative aesthetic, and went on to become one of the greatest artists, poets, and musicians in Japan's history. His entire life was dedicated to the study of "strategy", forged in battle and then applied to all creative expressions.

## Layout

This resource lives in a Github "Repo". Generallly Github is used to host code, but it works well for any textual resource. You can navigate through the repo in two ways:

1. Via links (see the Sitemap below on this page) that are in the text associated with each section (the _README.md_ file)
2. Deeper/forwards into the site via the file structure box provided by Github (viewable above), and outward/backwards via the breadcrumb/path (listed right above the file structure box.)

Additionally, if you want to work locally from your laptop while not being connected to the internet, you can do so by downloading this entire repo and opening the files locally (select the green _Clone or Download_ link above).

## Contributing

Contributions to this repo are welcome, and Github  allows for easy contributions if you are familiar with the interface. If you'd like to contribute but don't want to take the time to learn github, just email me your contributions to mreveley (at) gmail.com.
