# Way of the SunVox

Way of the SunVox is a resource for the music creation application SunVox. It is divided into 2 parts - a Tutorial and library of Sunsynths.

Way of the SunVox is a play on "Way of the Sword", coined by Miyamoto Musashi, the greatest Samurai who ever lived, in his [Book of Five Rings](https://archive.org/stream/MiyamotoMusashi-BookOfFiveRingsgoRinNoSho/Book_of_Five_Rings_djvu.txt), dictated to his understudy on his deathbed in 1645. He was undefeated in over 30 duels to the death, and after a certain number of years even began fighting with wooden kendo swords instead of metal, considering himself invincible. Upon retiring from duelling, he turned his back on the potential for a school or royal patronage in order to live the life of a creative aesthetic, and went on to become one of the greatest artists and poets in Japans history. His entire life was dedicated to the study of "strategy", forged in battle and then applied to all creative activities. I think Musashi's concept strategy can be applied well to SunVox - It is unconventional, spartan, simple, fast, efficient, and extremely powerful. The user needs to surrender to and accept it to reach the higher levels of mastery, but once there, you can do things that are just not possible in other music making environments.

## [Tutorial](Tutorial)
The tutorial is intended to be comprehensive, and works from the basics up through advanced techniques for achieving different objectives in sunvox. Animated gifs with text descriptions as well as SunVox projects are provided for reference throughout. In cases where an advanced technique is drawn from a forum post or another creator, that creator is credited.

## [Sunsyths](Sunsynths)
The Sunsynth library is a collection of instruments, effects, presets, modules, and metamodules - basically anything that can produce or process sound. These are all saved as sunsynth files, which are basically a patch, similar to how you might think of a modular synth patch. One of the coolest things about SunVox is how everything is build up from module primitives native to the app, so the line between "instrument", "plugin", "preset", "UI" etc, as in most music creation environments, is non-existent. SunVox exists at a level of abstraction below a traditional DAW (ie. Ableton, Logic, etc) but above a musical coding environment (ie. MaxMSP, Reaktor, SuperCollider, Pure Data, etc.) This turns out to be ideal for being able to design any sound you want in really powerful but simple interface, but not get sucked into instrument design/coding concerns, which can easily move in to replace the music making process using lower level environments.

This resource exists in a Github "Repo". Generallly Github is used to host code, but it works really well for any textual resource really. You can navigate through the repo just as you would a site really, with links that are in the text associated with each section or by navigating within the file structure that is visible at the top of whatever section you're in. Github also allows for easy contributing if you are familiar with the interface, and contributions to this repo are very welcome. If you'd like to contribute but don't want to get into learning github, just email me your contributions to mreveley (at) gmail.com.
